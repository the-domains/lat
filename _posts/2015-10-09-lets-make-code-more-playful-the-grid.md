description: 'Flowhub.io: The Evolving UI for the NoFlo Development Environment. I recently wrote about my frustrations with Photoshop - feeling detached from the collaborative environment where we build our software, systems and products: Photoshop is not a Design Tool. How I aim to collaborate with the team at NoFlo is by bringing tools and systems together and bridging the gap between design and development.'
